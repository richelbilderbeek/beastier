## beastier 1.4.4 (2018-08-05)

### NEW FEATURES

  * None

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * None

### BUG FIXES

  * `run_beast2` had a parameter called `overwrite_state_file`, which is renamed 
    to `overwrite` and states if the `.log` file and `.trees` files will be overwritten, 
    like BEAST2 does. This is a bug fix, as the obsolete parameter name did not
    prevent the state file being overwritten.

### DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

  * Calling `run_beast2` with a parameter called `overwrite_state_file` is obsolete. 
    Use the parameter `overwrite` instead.
